- 👋 Hi, I’m @bashdan
- 👀 I’m interested in computer (OS and systems) security as well as functional programming (for fun.)
- 🌱 I’m currently in school to finish my BS in Computer Science and I'm quite undecided on going to grad school.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on chess engines and other games-playing algorithms, including generic (Zillions of Games) style algorithms.
- 📫 How to reach me at my LinkedIn or email at hawkeyedaniel@gmail.com
